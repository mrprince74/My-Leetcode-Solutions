## My solutions to the Leetcode 75 problems sheet.

### Solutions are written in C++ and sometimes python. 
#### The repo is divided into Tags just like the division of tags on Leetcode. So it is easier for someone to get the problem he/she wants. 
#### If I had more than one solution/idea to a problem I include it as well with some notes if needed.
